Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I've created this cool and modern weather app using python and pyqt5. This helps in getting all weather information about a city along with few days of future forecast.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Weatherly] --> B(Forecasted Weather Pane)

B --> D(Basic Weather Outputs)
B --> E(Four Days Forecast with detailed information)
B --> F(Get current weather details button)
C --> G(Current Temperature with day's low and high)
C --> H(Current Location Details)
C --> I(Dynamic Weather Icon which changes with the weather)
```
